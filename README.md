# travelPlanner

This is a basic travel planner that aims to fetch data API from public transport so people can travel on time on their daily commute to work or anywhere.

I fetch data via https://pastebin.com/raw/d9wNLA4k in example for the purpose of this task, we could've also fetch data via Amazon AWS too or Google.

To run the server, do a npm start and emulate Android project. I use the Nexus API 23 with 6.5GB ram for the emulator.

I used the Visual Studio IDE (src) folder for the React components and Android Studio (android) for the activities. 

The task aims to show data pagination and fecthing data via POST or GET from public available sources.
